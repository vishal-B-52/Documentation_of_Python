# Polymorphism :-
"""
Polymorphism means ability to take various forms. It could be an attribute or functions or variables or methods or anything
enlisted in Python.
For Ex:- We will add 5 and 6 in two forms and glance on it's results.
"""

print(5 + 6)
print("5" + "6")

"""
The output of both statements are "11 and 56" respectively. The numbers were same but resulted differed both times because 
the numbers took different form in the second statement. In the first statement numbers were in 'int' form which resulted 
in addition of numbers. But in the 2nd statement the numbers were in 'string' form which resulted in concatenation of numbers.
Here, the numbers changed their form and it resulted in different outputs. That's what Polymorphism means.

Polymorphism can be achieved by over-riding an attribute ,function or a statement in OOP.
